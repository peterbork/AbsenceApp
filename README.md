# AbsenceApp
The App gives student of EAL the possiblity to handle Absence in a new way. 
Students have 2 options, either to check in manually, or toggle automatic ON: The automatic setting also tracks the users locations when the app is in the background, and will notify the user through push-notifications whenever they enter or leave the schools area.

AbsenceApp is cross platform, and should run flawless on both iOS and Android. 
Note:
* The app is mainly developed using iOS
* Running the app on an android emulator may require the Google Play Intel x86 Atom image located in `Preferences>SDK Locations>Android`. Additionally the Google Play Services tool needs to be enabled.

# AbsenceApp
This app gives students of EAL the possiblity of tracking their attendance and absence, either through manual or automatic check-in. 
When automatic check-in is enabled, the app will track the user through the means of geofencing, automatically handling checking in and out while notifying the user through push notifications.

AbsenceApp is completely cross-platform; thus, all the features are available on both iOS and Android.

Notes:
* Credentials required for the login are username "nico9699" and password "secret".
* Though cross-platform, iOS should be used for the best results as the emulator is more reliable than its Android counterpart.
* Running the app on an Android emulator requires the installation of Google Play Services. If using the emulator bundled with Visual Studio, select the Google Play Intel x86 Atom image for Android 7.1 in the SDK Manager for the best results. Additionally, the Google Play Services tool might be required.
* The app will prompt the user for the necessary permissions. However, even with error-handling in place, it's still possible to prevent the app from running correctly if permissions are altered or incorrectly set up. For the best results, make sure that location permission is set to "Always" on iOS and is enabled on Android.
* If the interface on the check-in page doesn't update, use the "Get status" button to refresh the interface.
